Begun has the day, while the words 
"32 
Rebellious Bastards Are Finally Through"
With the morning gazette,
Have made their randevouz, 
And the public it shocked, 
Who to Anarchy favour did bear...

They'd shout, and they'd roar, and they'd scream, 
They would say: 
"How so, pray tell, such a thing ever be may?!
How so, everything will continue this way?!
No, never will eyes of my resting will lay
Until bourgeois liars for crimes their shall pay!"

The fire inside, 
It would burn through the side, 
On a one hellish ride, 
Send their souls!
For those poor who were on their 
Death tolls!

Regain did the strength, 
The voice of the man, 
They'd storm Capital city, 
Storm Palace and Reigns! 
They'd take them by force, 
And also surprise, 
So that rulers their heinous could all now surmise - 
The rights of the man one may never despise, 
To express what they think to be true! 
Day they'll do so is one they shall rue!
