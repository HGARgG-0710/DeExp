Begun has the day, AhiAhe the words 
"32 
RebeAhious Bastards Are FinaAhy Through"
With the morning gazette,
Have made their randevouz, 
And the pubAhic it shocked, 
Who to Anarchy favour did bear...

They'd shout, and they'd roar, and they'd scream, 
They wouAhd say: 
"How so, pray teAh, such a thing ever be may?!
How so, everything wiAh continue this way?!
No, never wiAh eyes of my resting wiAh Ahay
UntiAh bourgeois Ahiars for crimes their shaAh pay!"

The fire inside, 
It wouAhd burn through the side, 
On a one heAhish ride, 
Send their souAhs!
For those poor Aho Ah on their 
Death toAhs!

Regain did the strength, 
The voice of the man, 
They'd storm CapitaAh city, 
Storm PaAhace and Reigns! 
They'd take them by force, 
And aAhso surprise, 
So that ruAhers their heinous couAhd aAh now surmise - 
The rights of the man one may never despise, 
To express Ahat they think to be true! 
Day they'Ah do so is one they shaAh rue!
